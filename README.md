## Introduction

Sequential data is one of the most commonly observed forms of data. These can range from time series (sequences of observations occurring through time) to non-temporal sequences such as DNA nucleotides. Time series such as audio signals and stock prices are often of particular interest as changing patterns over time naturally provide many interesting opportunities and challenges for machine learning.

This library specifically aims to tackle classification problems for isolated sequences by creating an interface to a number of classification algorithms.

Despite these types of sequences sounding very specific, you probably observe some of them on a regular basis!

**Some examples of classification problems for isolated sequences include classifying**:

- a word utterance by its speech audio signal,
- a hand-written character according to its pen-tip trajectory,
- a hand or head gesture in a video or motion-capture recording.

## Features

The algorithms provided within Sequentia support the use of multivariate observation sequences with different durations.

### Classification algorithms

- [x] Hidden Markov Models (via [`hmmlearn`](https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn))<br/><em>Learning with the Baum-Welch algorithm [[1]](#references) and classifying using the MAP rule</em>
  - [x] Gaussian Mixture Model emissions
  - [x] Linear, left-right and ergodic topologies
- [x] Dynamic Time Warping k-Nearest Neighbors (via [`dtaidistance`](https://github.com/wannesm/dtaidistance))
  - [x] Custom distance-weighted predictions
  - [x] Multi-processed predictions

## Acknowledgments

In earlier versions of the package (<0.8.0), an approximate dynamic time warping algorithm implementation ([`fastdtw`](https://github.com/slaypni/fastdtw)) was used in hopes of speeding up k-NN predictions, as the authors of the original FastDTW paper [[2]](#references) claim that approximated DTW alignments can be computed in linear memory and time - compared to the O(N^2) runtime complexity of the usual exact DTW implementation.

However, I was recently contacted by [Prof. Eamonn Keogh](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/) (at _University of California, Riverside_), whose recent work [[3]](#references) makes the surprising revelation that FastDTW is generally slower than the exact DTW algorithm that it approximates. Upon switching from the `fastdtw` package to [`dtaidistance`](https://github.com/wannesm/dtaidistance) (a very solid implementation of exact DTW with fast pure C compiled functions), DTW k-NN predictions times were indeed reduced drastically.

I would like to thank Prof. Eamonn Keogh for directly reaching out to me regarding this finding!
