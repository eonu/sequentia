        Parameters
        ----------
        self: KNNRegressor

        k:
            Number of neighbors.

        weighting:
            A callable that specifies how distance weighting should be
            performed.

            The callable should accept a :class:`numpy:numpy.ndarray` of DTW
            distances, apply an element-wise weighting transformation to the
            matrix of DTW distances, then return an equally-sized
            :class:`numpy:numpy.ndarray` of weightings.

            If ``None``, then a uniform weighting of 1 will be applied to all
            distances.

        window: The size of the Sakoe—Chiba band global constrant as a
            fraction of the length of the shortest of the two sequences being
            compared.

            - A larger window will give more freedom to the DTW alignment,
              allowing more deviation but leading to potentially slower
              computation.
              A window of 1 is equivalent to full DTW computation with no
              global constraint applied.
            - A smaller window will restrict the DTW alignment, and possibly
              speed up the DTW computation.
              A window of 0 is equivalent to Euclidean distance.

        independent:
            Whether or not to allow features to be warped independently from
            each other. See [#dtw_multi]_ for an overview of independent and
            dependent dynamic time warping.

        use_c:
            Whether or not to use fast pure C compiled functions from
            `dtaidistance <https://github.com/wannesm/dtaidistance>`__ to
            perform the DTW computations.

        n_jobs:
            Maximum number of concurrently running workers.

            - If 1, no parallelism is used at all (useful for debugging).
            - If -1, all CPUs are used.
            - If < -1, ``(n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs)`` are used — e.g. ``n_jobs=-2``
              uses all but one.

        random_state:
            Seed or :class:`numpy:numpy.random.RandomState` object for
            reproducible pseudo-randomness.
